     The problem we face is that using a variable in include() like include(broadcaster.name + "/head ")
     is looking for the path to that file regarding the current one. Thus, as we are in the header, the
     "current file" is changing for each page so the path actually change. So as we can not say that include
     must look for paths in views instead of current file, we can not do a dynamic include.
